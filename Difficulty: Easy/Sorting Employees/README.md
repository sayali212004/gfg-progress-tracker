<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorting-employees5907/0">Sorting Employees</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Easy</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are given two arrays, <strong>employee</strong> and <strong>salary</strong>, where employee[i] denotes the name of the i<sup>th</sup> employee, and salary[i] denotes the salary of the i<sup>th</sup> employee. Your task is to sort the employee array based on their salaries in non-decreasing order. If two or more employees have the same salary, sort them alphabetically by their names. Return the sorted employee array.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>employee = ["chef", "geek"], salary = [100, 50]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["geek", "chef"]
<strong>Explanation</strong>: "geek" has a lower salary (50) than "chef" (100), so "geek" comes first.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>employee = ["ram", "shyam", "rohan"], salary = [60, 45, 60]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["shyam", "ram", "rohan"]<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> "shyam" has the lowest salary (45), so "shyam" comes first, followed by "ram" and "rohan," who both have the same salary (60). They keep their original order.</span></pre>
